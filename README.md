app for Valeureux local currency


## What is the Valeureux app for?
The Valeureux is a local complementary currency used in Li√®ge (Belgium). The aim of the app is to provide a payment platform for the local currency. This will enable all the users of the currency to: 
- subscribe to the app, 
- top up some money (by wiring Euros into a given bankaccount), 
- check her/his account balance,
- wire Valeureux local currency into another user's bank account, 
- request a payment from another user (either via a QR code system or via a request that the user can send to a specific user),
- update her/his profile.

There are 3 user types:
- citizens,
- shop owners,
- administrators

In a later stage, this application should be available as a platform. Any local complementary currency willing to deploy an electronic version of their currency should be able to do so in a few clicks via www.crncy.org.
